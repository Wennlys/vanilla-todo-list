# SPA To-Do List

[Click here to test it on the live environment](https://wennlys.github.io/vanilla-todo-list/).

This is a To-Do List made only with Vanilla JavaScript using the module pattern.

There are two pages by now, Home page, where you find the to-do list itself, and About page, which is dynamically
 updated with my Github profile.

Both Header and Footer are once rendered components, it means changing between the pages will only re-render the main content. That saves machine processing per page change.

The application does not use any external database, so it saves all items on your browser's local storage.
